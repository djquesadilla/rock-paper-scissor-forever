# Rock, Paper, Scissor Forever 🪨 📝 ✂️ ♾️

I had this in mind for a while but was I lazy on thinking how to do it. So I used ChatGPT to help me on this one.

I prompted:

```
I want to make a javascript web animation called "Rock, paper, scissor forever" where I have 30 objects (10 rock emojis, 10 paper emojis, 10 scissor emojis) moving randomly in the screen and whenever two of them hit if handles the collision following the rock paper scissor game rules, which is, the object that loses transforms into the object that won.

Can you help me write code for that?
```

And it wrote me almost all the code. Then a tweak here, a tweak there and the internet won another useless animation.
